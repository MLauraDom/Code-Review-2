            <h2>New Generation and Technologie</h2>
            <img src="../img/tech.jpg" alt="New Generation" />
            <p>Today, technology is very important because it is used for almost everything and like everything.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Advantages of technology</h3>
            <p>First, the evolution of technology is beneficial to humans for several reasons. At the medical level,
                technology can help treat more sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful
                viruses and bacteria.</p>
            <p>The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies
                can communicate more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified. </p>
            <p>For companies, progress in implementing strategic technology trends is helping them save time and
                therefore, money. Exchanges are faster especially with the internet. Sales and purchases are now
                facilitated and possible worldwide. This allows businesses to buy raw materials with discounts or at
                reduced prices. Similarly, global tourism has grown.</p>
            <p>Technology has also increased the productivity of almost every industry in the world. Thanks to
                technology, we can even pay with bitcoins instead of using banks. The digital coin has been such a game
                changing factor, that many realised that this is the right time to open a bitcoin demo account.</p>
            <p>When observed more closely, new things are discovered every day. Let’s take for instance when radio waves
                were discovered, radio broadcasts followed suit almost immediately. The same applies to the television
                and electricity. If no one had discovered that electricity could be generated, then the entertainment
                industry wouldn’t be at it’s current stage of development.</p>
            <p>Technology improves daily lives; allowing to move physical storage units to virtual storage banks and
                more. Scientists of the time are also able to send astronauts to the moon thanks to technology.</p>
